        <h5 class="texxt-sucess text-capitalize">I had visited in Dec 2018.</h5>
        <p>The 92-seater Prithvi cafe is an open air cafe lined by big trees and bamboos. The place is renowned for its Irish coffee which has the perfect mix of froth and whiskey. The sandwiches and kebabs are equally yummy. This is an ideal place for a lazy Sunday afternoon when one wants to take a break from the maddening pace of the city and just relax in nature's bounty. This cafe is attached to the legendary Prithvi Theatre. The place is perfect to take your chess board, book or laptop and just relax over coffee.</p>

    <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. 

      The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and horribly insane than he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century.
      
      The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear. 
      
      And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) are certainly questionable, as long as you don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. This is my favorite movie of all time (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie opening night in the theatre. However even upon second viewings the film remains an utter blast to watch with tons of replay value due to the many eastereggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless this is a superhero masterpiece!</p>

    <p>Why it rocks:
      The idea of an 8-year-old boy who is mistakenly left home alone by his family and has to protect the house from two bumbling burglars is pretty entertaining.
      Memorable moments such as the Angels with Filthy Souls film-within-a-film, the entire House defence sequence or Kevin messing around the home after realising his family left.
      Solid acting from most of the cast with Macaulay Culkin doing a great performance as Kevin McCallister.
      As mention on WIR#3, Kevin McCallister is pretty much a likable and memorable character of all time and he has a lot of character development. He is a rambunctious eight-year-old with a penchant for creating harmful inventions, until he met Harry and Marv, and he must protect his own home and he did it successfully.
      Harry and Marv are also absolutely hilarious and make superb partners in crime. They have perfect compatability with Harry being the arrogant, but somewhat intelligent one, with Marv a cautious but easily frightened person. Despite their stupidity, they are competent and determined villains.
      The use of foreshadowing in the film, such as Kevin's passport accidentally being thrown away and the props for the booby-traps being seen in the basement, is brilliant.
      John Williams' musical score is brilliant, as it's one of the best scores to come from a Christmas movie.
      Plenty of well composed musical numbers that are well remembered: The timeless song, "Somewhere in My Memory" and the song "O Holy Night" is very emotional and beautifully sung by a church choir.
      Memorable and funny lines, such as "Kevin!", "Why the hell are you dressed like a chicken?", "Keep the change, you filthy animal!", and "Kevin, what did you do to my room?!"'
      A beautifully emotional ending that ties up all the loose ends.
      The booby traps, despite their deadly and dangerous nature in real life, are very memorable, especially the blowtorch, the burning doorknob, the broken ornaments, and the paint cans.</p>
